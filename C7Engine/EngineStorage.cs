	 * This class stores references to data that the engine needs between calls from the player.
	 * Most obviously this includes a reference to the C7GameData, but it might eventually
	 * also include things like keeping track of which networked players are up to date.
	 *
	 * Note that we should NOT store pointers to pieces of the game data here; that will
	 * all be handled within C7GameData.  We just need a pointer to the main, top level
	 * so we don't forget the state of the game after we create it.
