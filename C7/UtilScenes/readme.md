# UtilScenes

These aren't necessarily for the game. This is especially to help with dev tasks.

## ViewPcxFlc

I wanted to browse Pcx files and realized I didn't have an easy way to do so, but I do have Godot, a PCX library, and a Godot file browser working. So this is to open and view Pcx files. It opens in the Civ3 directory by default.

It needs some intelligence on positioning, but hey it works. FLC support will be added later.

Just open the scene in Godot and run it. It is not hooked up to the game menu.
