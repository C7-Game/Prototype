# TempTiles

While working on LegacyMap I need a set of 'native' tiles to pull data from. We have no native structures yet, so this is a temporary and exploratory scene and code to read a legacy SAV file and provide data for the LegacyMap renderer.

Mock city and unit data may be included, too, as their info will be needed to draw a game-ready map.

BIQ data will also need to be read and probably exposed here.

## To Do

- Provide sane size for file open dialog
- Provide sane size and/or spacing for action buttons
- Perhaps experiment with resonsive layout for menu
- Render proper graphics
